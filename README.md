Big Data Project - New York Crime Complaint Analysis

Introduction : 
The recording and tracking of crime data serves both national and local interests. The NYPD captures crime complaint data to obtain intelligence about crime, analyze crime patterns, identify high- crime areas, develop strategies for combating or preventing crime, allocate resources, and measure the effectiveness of its efforts. This report attempts to summarize those updates and improvements and the resulting impact on the crime-reporting and auditing process.

About the Dataset : 
The dataset contains the complaint data of the crimes occurring from the year of 2006 - 2015 in the New York city. It includes the fields like the complaint number, date of occurrence, report date, crime description and codes, location, premises, jurisdiction involved with that case, the longitude and latitude of the location of the crime place.

Summary : 
Implemented various design, filtering and data organization patterns of the Hadoop MapReduce framework to infer different types of analysis. Also performed exploratory analysis using Tableau charts that helps in improving the auditing process and prevention of crimes
